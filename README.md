## Problem Statements
<div align="justify">
  
In today’s rapidly evolving educational landscape, students face several significant challenges that hinder their learning experiences:

- <b>Technology Ethics:</b> The increasing use of AI in education raises ethical concerns, such as over rely on generative AI, data privacy and algorithmic bias, which can inadvertently reinforce inequalities and must be carefully managed to ensure fair and equitable learning opportunities for all students.

- <b>Engagement Issues:</b> Traditional educational methods often fail to engage students, leading to lower motivation and participation. Innovative tools are needed to create interactive and stimulating learning environments.

- <b>Lack of Personalization:</b> Many educational systems provide a one-size-fits-all approach, which does not cater to individual learning styles, needs, or paces. This can lead to disengagement and unmet potential.

- <b>Limited Access to Resources:</b> A significant number of students, particularly in underserved areas, lack access to quality educational resources and technology. This disparity creates a gap in learning opportunities and outcomes.

Participants in this hackathon are tasked with leveraging AI and Cisco’s advanced technologies to develop solutions that address these challenges, ensuring that education is accessible, engaging, and tailored to the needs of all learners.
